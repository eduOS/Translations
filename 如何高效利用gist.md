What You Can Do With Gists on Github? 
如何高效利用Gist？
- - - - - - 
Github is the popular website among software developers for sharing code. The site hosts over 12 million open-source projects — including games, books and even fonts — making Github the largest code repository on the Internet.  
Github作为代码分享平台在开发者中非常流行。此平台托管了包括游戏、书籍以至于字体在内的一千两百多万个项目，这是其成为互联网上最大的代码库。  

Github offers another useful service called Gist that developers often use to dump their code snippets but Gists aren’t just for geeks and coders — they offer something for everybody. If you have ever heard of web apps like Pastebin or Pastie, Gist are similar but more polished, they are free of advertising and loaded with more features.  
Github还提供另一个非常有用的功能，这就是Gist。 开发人员常常使用Gist记录他们的代码片段，但是Gist不仅仅是为极客和码农开发的，每个人都可以用到它。 如果你听说过类似Pastebin或者Pastie这样的网页应用的话，那我们就可以看出它们和Gist很像，但是Gist比它们要更优雅。因为这些免费应用一般含有广告，而且带有很多其他杂七杂八的功能。  

Gist – They aren’t just for Geeks!  
Gist - 任何人都能用得着  

Here are some areas where you can utilize the Gist service. And you don’t have to be a geek for this.  
在以下几个方面你不是极客也可以用到Gist。  

### 1. Write Text Anonymously  
### 1. 匿名发表文字  

You don’t have to create an account at Github to use Gists. Just go to gist.github.com, write any block of text in the space provided and create a Gist. You can choose to have a secret Gist that will not be visible to search engines but only to those who know the URL of that secret Gist.  
你不需要拥有Github账号就可以使用Gist。 用浏览器打开gist.github.com，在窗口中写下你想说的就可以创建一个Gist。 你可以发表一个秘密的Gist，也就是说这个Gist将不会被他人搜索到而只对直接在浏览器中输入URL的人可见。  

### 2. Track Changes like a Wiki  
### 2. 能像wiki一样记录历史  

When you edit the content of a Gist that has already been published, the previous versions of the Gist are also preserved. You can hit the Revisions tab to track edits made over time and there’s a built-in diff engine that will visually highlight the changes between any two versions of a gist. This can also be used for comparing text files.  
如果你修改已经发表了的Gist的话之前的所有版本都将被保存。 你可以点击Revisions按钮按时间浏览，而且你可以通过内置的diff引擎查看任意两个版本间的差异。 这也可以用于比较文本文件。

### 3. Publish Gists in Rich Text  
### 3. 用富文本发表Gist

While gists only accept plain text, you can use the Markdown format to publish your text in rich HTML format. You can add lists, images (hosted externally) and even Tables that are not supported in the original Markdown specification. When you are done writing the text in Markdown, remember to save the file with a .md extension.  
虽然Gist只能用纯文本来写，但是你可以用markdown来发表html格式的Gist。 你可以添加列表、图片（图床上的）和表格。当你用markdown的时候不要忘了文件名要以.md为后缀。

### 4. Gist as a Writing Platform  
### 4. 把Gist当作一个写作平台  

While there exist plenty of writing engines — from Blogger to Medium to Tumblr — you can also Github’s Gist service to quickly publish your writings on the web. Create a Gist either in plain text or markdown format and then use roughdraft.io to publish that Gist as a standalone web page. It’s like integrating Readability with your Gists. And you can use emoji (smileys) too!  


5. Host Single Page Websites on Gist

Bl.ocks is one of the most interesting applications built for Gists. You can write your HTML, CSS and JavaScript code in plain text, save the Gist as index.html and then use bl.ocks.org to serve the rendered version of that HTML web page as it should appear in the browser. For instance, here’s a live version of an HTML file that is hosted on gist.github.com.

There are bandwidth constraints obviously but bl.ock.org is still an excellent tool for hosting your HTML through Gists. The other alternative is Google Drive.

6. Maintain a Task List

You can use Gists to keep track of pending tasks (see example). The tasks are written in a special syntax in plain text but they are rendered as a list of check boxes.

- [x] Pick the flowers
- [ ] Call John 9303032332
- [x] Cancel cable subscription
- [ ] Book the flight tickets
You can check or uncheck the items and the source text will update automatically. If your Gist is public, anyone can see your to-do lists but only the gist owner can change the status of individual tasks.

7. Gist as a Web Clipper

The GistBox add-on for Google Chrome lets you save text snippets from web pages as public or private gists. You can even add labels, or #hashtags, to your gists making discovery easier.

8. Embed Gists in Web Pages

You can embed any Gist in your web pages with a line of JavaScript code. The embedded Gists maintain all the formatting and syntax highlighting and visitors to your website can easily clone (or fork) your Gist into their own Github accounts. There’s also a plugin and shortcode for embedding Gists in WordPress blogs.

9. Measure the Traffic

You can use Google Analytics to measure the traffic to your Gists. Since Github does not allow JavaScript code to run inside plain text Gists, we can use the GA Beacon to log visits in real-time to Gists.

Add this line to your Gists, save in Markdown format and it will add a transparent tracking image to your Gists.

10. Manage Gists from the Desktop

Gisto is free desktop application that lets you manage your Gists outside the browser. You can search Gists, edit the content of gists, view revisions over time and also share Gists. The app is available for Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. The other alternative is GistBox which is a web app.

In 2009, Dr. Heidi Grant Halvorson made a surprising discovery in the science of motivation. She conducted a series of studies **where** she asked participants to solve a set of puzzles and problems. In one group — the “be-good” group — participants were told that their score reflected their “conceptual and analytical abilities.” They should try to solve as many problems as possible and aim for a high score to demonstrate how good they were. In another group — the “get-better” group — participants were told that each problem was a “training tool” and that they ought to “take advantage of this valuable learning opportunity” to improve their problem-solving skills. [1]  
09年Heidi Grant Halvorson 在研究人的动机时发现一个惊人的秘密。 她做了一些列的实验，在实验中她要求被试解决一系列的难题。 她把被试分为两组。一组命名为“be-good”组，此组中的被试被告知他们的得分反应了他们的认知和分析能力。他们必须尽量多的解决问题来体现他们的能力。 另一组被命名为“get-better”组，其成员被告知所有问题都是用来训练他们的，他们应该充分利用这次学习的机会来提高问题解决技巧。[1]  

For some _**participants**_ in each group, Halvorson also increased the difficulty level by introducing a few challenges. She interrupted participants to use up some of their **allotted** time. She threw in extra, unsolvable problems to frustrate them, without telling participants that the problems were unsolvable.  
Halvorson还做了些干预。Halvorson对每一组的某些成员的题目增加了难度。 有时候她又打扰他们一下以耗费掉他们的一些时间。 而且，她给他们一些额外的根本无法解答的问题来让他们受挫，当然她不会告诉他们这些问题无法解答。

What surprised Halvorson was how the two groups dealt with the challenges. _**The ones**_ in the “get-better” group remained unfazed and solved as many as problems in the challenging conditions as the easy ones. They stayed motivated and kept trying to learn. The ones in the “be-good” group, however, were so demoralized when they faced the challenges and obstacles that they solved substantially fewer problems than those who didn’t have to face them.  
让Halvorson感到吃惊的是两组成员对待这次挑战的不同。 “get-better”组不慌不忙而且在紧张环境中和在轻松环境中解决的问题一样多。 他们动机强烈而且一直保持学习的热情。而 “be-good”组呢？ 他们在遇到挑战和困难的时候显得心慌意乱，毫无疑问，他们解决了额较少的问题。  

And those differences happened just because of how the initial goal was framed.  
差距仅仅来自初始目标的设置。  

**Define Mastery Goals, Not Performance Ones, For Difficult Problems**  
**对于较难的问题，我们应该设立掌握它的目标而不是展现自己**    

Halvorson’s experiments illustrate the difference between a mastery goal, where you aim to learn and get better at some skill, and a performance goal, where you aim to be good, either to demonstrate you’re talented or to outperform other people.  
Halvorson的实验展现了以学习和获得更好的技巧为目的的“掌握它”的目标和显示自己才华或强过他人的“表现式”的目标的不同。  

Your objective for a given problem can often be framed in either way:  
你解决问题的目标常常来自以下原因：  

- Are you studying for tests to learn and to grow or to demonstrate your intelligence?  
- 你是为了学习或者提高而学习还是为了展现自己的智力？  
- Are you spending years on a PhD to innovate in your research area or to because you think it’ll be a good stepping stone for your career?  
- 你读博的时候花费数年时间是为了在你的研究领域追求有所创新还是为了得到事业的垫脚石？  
- Are you training for a 10K race to improve your own time or to beat the competition?  
- 你为万米跑比赛训练是为了缩短自己的时间还是打败你的对手？  
- Are you working on side projects and brushing up your coding skills to become a better software engineer or to simply get a better-paying job?  
- 你做业余项目（side projects），努力提高你的编程开发技巧是为了成为一个更好的软件工程师还是简单的为了找一个更好的工作？  

The actions you perform to accomplish a mastery goal or a performance goal might be the same, but your motivation and your mindset will be quite different. When you’re focused on improving your own skills, rather than on demonstrating them, you’re less likely to get discouraged by obstacles, time pressure, or other unexpected challenges. You’ll believe that you can still improve and do better next time. You’ll have a growth mindset.  
你为了掌握的目标或为了表现得目标所采取的行动有时候是相同的，但是你的动机和心态就会大有不同。  当你竭力为了提高自己的技巧而不是为了展现自己的技巧时你就不太会因为困难和时间限制或其他不利因素而受挫。你会相信你能够有所提高而在下一次做的更好。 你有一个成长的心态。    

That’s not to say performance goals don’t **have their place**. Professor Dan Ariely conducted a series of experiments at MIT, the University of Chicago, and in rural Madurai, India. _**Subjects**_ were asked to participate in a number of games and offered either a small, moderate, or large financial incentive for performing well on each particular game — a clear example of performance goals in action. For memory games, creativity games, or motor skill games, those offered a large financial incentive actually performed worse than those offered smaller ones. The only task where participants actually performed better when offered a large financial incentive was when they were performing the mechanical task of alternating keypresses on a keyboard as quickly as possible. [2]  
这也不是说展现式目标就没有任何用处。 Dan Ariely教授在MIT、芝加哥大学还有印度的马杜赖做了一系列实验。他组织被试参与一系列的比赛而且每种比赛按照奖励的额度不同分为三种小额奖励的比赛、中等奖励的比赛和大额奖励的比赛。 这是一个明显的以表现为目的的例子。无论在在记忆力比赛，创造力比赛或者运动技能的比赛中提供大额奖励奖励刺激的参赛者的表现要比提供小额奖励的参赛者差一些。[2]  

Daniel Pink reinforces this idea in his book Drive, explaining that when there is a clear goal and when the problem can be solved by brute force, performance-based goals — especially those incentivized by a reward — work extremely well. It’s when the problems require some ingenuity or some mental effort, that performance-based goals and rewards start to **backfire and reduce** performance. [3]    
Daniel Pink在他的著作_Drive_中发展了这一观点。他解释说，当存在一个明确目标的时候或者对于可暴力解决的问题来说以表现为基础的目标，尤其是在奖励的刺激下的目标非常奏效。 而当问题需要独创性或脑力才能解决的时候，这类目标或者奖励就会适得其反了。[3]   

**Making This Research Useful** 
**如何从这个研究中有所得**  
Set the right type of goal for the task at hand to get better results.  
为了有一个更好的结果，我们需要设立合适种类的目标。  

You’re better off setting a performance goal when you can brute force through the problem, particularly if there’s a reward at stake. For example, performance goals work well if you’re:  
当你可以靠蛮力解决问题的时候你就设立表现式的目标， 尤其是可以的到奖励的时候。 比如当你：  

- Triaging through a long bug or feature list.  
- 给一个长bug或特征列表分类的时候。  
- Responding to a long backlog of personal emails or customer support emails.  
- 回复那些积压已久的私人邮件或者请求客户支持的电子邮件的时候。  
- Finishing a laundry list of chores around the apartment.  
- 收拾公寓的诸多杂务的时候。  
- Mechanically grinding through any number of mindless tasks.  
- 机械的折腾那些不需动脑子的事务的时候。  

It can be helpful for each of these short-term tasks, where there isn’t much opportunity to master a new skill, to instead tie a reward to the completion of the task. If you get everything done, then you’ll treat yourself (or your team) to something nice. The performance incentive can help you get things done faster.  
对于这些短期见效的事务来说非常有用， 通常你不能由此掌握新的技能所以你需要让奖励来与完成这些事建立联系。 如果你做好了这些，你就可以适当的犒劳一下自己或小组。 这样就能更快的做好这些事。  

But for our long-term goals, we’ll stay much more motivated in the long run if we adopt a mindset where we’re aiming to master our skills rather than to hit a performance goal. For example,  
但是对于长期的目标的话，如果我们以掌握技能而不是得到奖励的心态来对待的话我们会更有动力。  比如：  

Rather than focusing on getting promoted to a staff engineering position at your company, focus on improving your engineering skills and your ability to create meaningful impact.  
与其致力于在公司得到提升，而不如把精力放在提高自己的技能和创造有建设性成果的能力上。  
Rather than training to win at some sport — whether it’s running, a tennis match, ultimate frisbee, etc. — train to become a better player or athlete.  
与其为了在诸如跑步、网球或极限飞盘等赛事中获得胜利还不如为了把自己训练成为更好的运动员。  
Rather than joining at a startup to get rich, join because you’re passionate about the problem space and excited to learn from the journey.  
与其为了变得富有而加入一家创业公司，还不如是因为你对这个要解决的问题充满兴趣而且极其想在创业旅途中学到本领。  

You’ll notice that long-term goals framed in terms of performance tend to rely on external factors outside of your control (whether your manager promotes you, whether you’re better than your opponent, or whether your startup succeeds). When you let environmental circumstances play such a large role in your success, it’s much harder to stay motivated when you encounter obstacles, just like the puzzle-solving participants in Halvorson’s experiments. If you instead focus on your own learning and on getting better, you’re much more likely to overcome pain points and actually succeed.  
你会注意到长期目标的达成需要借助超出你控制范围的外部因素，比如你的上级会不会提包你，你是否比你的竞争对手更强，你创业是否成功了。 当你让外部因素在你的成功中扮演如此重要的角色的时候当你遇到困难的时候就会动力不足了，就好比在Halvorson的实验中为了解决谜题的那些被试。 如果你聚焦于自己的学习和变得更好，那你就更有可能战神困难和成功。
